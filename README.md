# kaggle_chest_x_ray_images
### Developed a very basic Convolutional Neural Network that can detect whether a person has Pneumonia using X-Ray images
### Instead of using pretrained networks with more weights, tried to use very few layers and get state of the art results. 
### Proposed deep learning model produces a test accuracy of 93.5%, F1 score of 0.94 with a 0.97 recall rate on Pneumonia detection.
